title: 3D Printing Project 01 - Design & Print something functional
---

## **Overview:**
- **Objective:**
  - Introduce participants to the 3D printing process by modeling and printing a functional object.

- **Key Components:**
  - Basic understanding of 3D space .
  - Basic understanding of 3D modeling.
  - Basic understanding of 3D printing.
  - Hands-on experience with a 3D printer.
  - Post-printing steps.

## **Inspiration:**
- **Functional Object Ideas:**
  - Phone stands 
  - Cable organizers 
  - Pen Holders
  - Earphone Holders
  - Wall Hooks
  - Door Stops
  - Desk orgnizers
  - Bookends
  - Coasters
  - Drawer Knobs
  - Tool Holders
  - Customized Game Pieces

  - Browse online platforms listed below for a wide range of pre-designed functional objects for inspiration.

- **Customization Ideas:**
  - Colors, sizes, and minor modifications to personalize the chosen design.

## **Activities/Workflow:**
1. **Choosing an Object:**
   - Participants select a functional object from the provided list or propose their own ideas. Try browsing the web or see **Helpful Links** below for more resouces and inspiration. 
2. **The Design/Modeling:**
   - After you've decided on what to make, start modeling. Remember simple commands such as making solids and moving them in the 3D modeling space. These are the initial fisrt steps. See tutorials page for references.  
   - Don't forget to take measurments! How large is your object? Length, width, depth? Does it slip between other objects? If so, what tolerances should you allow? What are tolerances? 
   - Try different approaches. Think of the solution from someone else's point of view. 
   - When you think you're finished, then it's time to export your model. Go to File, Export, then select the proper format. Files in the **.stl** & **.obj** format usually work great!
3. **Preparing for Printing:**
   - Open your 3D Printing Software (Prusa), and familarize your self with the [User Interface (UI).](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ui-overview_1766) 
   - Drag and drop your exported file into Prusa. Or select File> Import> Import STL/...
   - Learn basic considerations such as moving, scaling, rotating, and infill.
   - Choose the best orientation to Print. Usually, if your model has a flat surface, try placing that directly on the print bed surface. 
   - When ready, select **Sice now** at the bottom right. This will 'slice' your model into horizontal layers that the printer will use. This is called **G-code** (or machine code). 
   - When you model has been sliced, select **Export G-code** at the bottom right. 
   - Save this file to an SD Card, and then plug into the 3D Printer (Prusa). You are ready to Print!
4. **Hands-On Printing:**
   - After plugging in your SD Card, on the 3D Printer (Prusa), select print from SD Card, and then choose your G-code file. 
   - The screen will then tell you the print bed is heating. Your print will begin shortly.
   - Observe the 3D printer in action and gain insight into the printing process.
5. **Post-Processing:**
   - Briefly cover post-processing steps, including removing supports (if any) and adding finishing touches.

## **Reflect and Share:**
- **Group Discussion:**
  - Reflect on the experience. What did you learn? What challenges did you face?
  - Share thoughts on the chosen functional object and the 3D printing process.

## **Taking Your Project to the Next Level:**
- **Experimentation:**
  - Encourage participants to experiment with different colors, sizes, or modifications for a unique touch.
  - Combine multiple 3D-printed parts to create more complex structures.
  - If necessary, try cutting your model into pieces with the Prusa tools on the left. Click [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779) to see how. 

## **Further Learning:**
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Explore advanced 3D printing techniques such as dual extrusion, multi-material printing, or complex geometries.
  - Learn about designing original 3D models using software like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/), or [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

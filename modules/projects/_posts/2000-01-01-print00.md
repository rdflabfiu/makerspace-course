title: 3D Printing Project 00 - Print something functional
---

## **Overview:**
- **Objective:**
  - Introduce participants to the 3D printing process by downloading and printing a functional object.
- **Key Components:**
  - Basic understanding of 3D printing.
  - Choosing and downloading a 3D model.
  - Hands-on experience with a 3D printer.
  - Post-printing steps.

## **Inspiration:** 
- **Functional Object Ideas:**
  - Keychains 
  - Phone stands 
  - Cable organizers 
  - Pen Holders
  - Earphone Holders
  - Planters
  - Wall Hooks
  - Cookie Cutters
  - Door Stops
  - Desk orgnizers
  - Bookends
  - Coasters
  - Drawer Knobs
  - Tool Holders
  - Customized Game Pieces

  - Browse online platforms listed below for a wide range of pre-designed functional objects.

- **Customization Ideas:**
  - Colors, sizes, and minor modifications to personalize the chosen design.

## **Activities/Workflow:**
1. **Choosing an Object:**
   - Participants select a functional object from the provided list or propose their own ideas.
2. **Downloading the Design:**
   - Visit platforms like [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) and download the chosen 3D model. See below in **Helpful Links** for more resources. 
3. **Preparing for Printing:**
   - Open your 3D Printing Software (Prusa), and familarize your self with the [User Interface (UI).](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/ui-overview_1766) 
   - Drag and drop your downloaded file into Prusa. Or select File> Import> Import STL/...
   - Learn basic considerations such as moving, scaling, rotating, and infill.
   - Choose the best orientation to Print. Usually, if your model has a flat surface, try placing that directly on the print bed surface. 
   - When ready, select **Sice now** at the bottom right. This will 'slice' your model into horizontal layers that the printer will use. This is called **G-code** (or machine code). 
   - When you model has been sliced, select **Export G-code** at the bottom right. 
   - Save this file to an SD Card, and then plug into the 3D Printer (Prusa). You are ready to Print!
4. **Hands-On Printing:**
   - After plugging in your SD Card, on the 3D Printer (Prusa), select print from SD Card, and then choose your G-code file. 
   - The screen will then tell you the print bed is heating. Your print will begin shortly.
   - Observe the 3D printer in action and gain insight into the printing process.
5. **Post-Processing:**
   - Briefly cover post-processing steps, including removing supports (if any) and adding finishing touches.

## **Reflect and Share:**
- **Group Discussion:**
  - Reflect on the experience. What did you learn? What challenges did you face?
  - Share thoughts on the chosen functional object and the 3D printing process.

## **Taking Your Project to the Next Level:**
- **Experimentation:**
  - Encourage participants to experiment with different colors, sizes, or modifications for a unique touch.
  - Combine multiple 3D-printed parts to create more complex structures.
  - If necessary, try cutting your model into pieces with the Prusa tools on the left. Click [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cut-tool_1779) to see how. 

## **Further Learning:**
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Explore advanced 3D printing techniques such as dual extrusion, multi-material printing, or complex geometries.
  - Learn about designing original 3D models using software like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/), or [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

## Introduction
  "Welcome to our exciting journey into the world of Maker Space! Today marks the beginning of a hands-on exploration where creativity knows no bounds. In this class, we will dive into the fascinating realm of Maker Spaces, learning about the various tools at our disposal and unleashing our creativity by crafting something meaningful from a simple yet versatile material—cardboard.

  Maker Spaces are collaborative environments where ideas come to life. They are equipped with an array of tools and materials that empower individuals to design, build, and innovate. Today, we will take our first steps in understanding these tools and putting our newfound knowledge to use by creating something practical out of cardboard.

  Now, let's set the stage for an exciting journey of discovery and creation as we embark on this Maker Space adventure!"

## Project

  -Make something useful with Cardboard 

  [Cardboard Challenge](https://cardboard-challenge.com/)

  **Understand Cardboard Properties:** Begin by understanding the properties of cardboard. Recognize its strengths, weaknesses, and flexibility. This understanding will guide design choices.

  **Brainstorm Ideas:** Brainstorm ideas for practical items that can be created with cardboard. Consider everyday problems that can be solved or needs that can be addressed.

  **Plan and Sketch:** Before cutting or assembling, plan and sketch a design. This helps visualize the final product and consider structural elements.

  **Measure Twice, Cut Once:** Emphasize the importance of accurate measurements. Don't forget to measure twice before making cuts to ensure precision and avoid wastage.

  **Utilize Templates:** Use templates, when available, for complex shapes or structures. Templates can be a helpful starting point and ensure consistency in design.

  **Explore Joining Techniques:** Explore various joining techniques such as tabs, flaps, and folds to connect pieces of cardboard securely. Experiment with different methods based on the project requirements.

  **Layering for Strength:** When appropriate, consider layering cardboard to increase strength. Gluing layers together can create a sturdier structure for certain projects.

  **Incorporate Fasteners:** Consider the use of fasteners like brads, paper clips, or even glue guns for securing pieces together. Discuss the pros and cons of each method.

  **Test and Iterate:** Encourage a culture of testing and iteration. Test any creations and be open to making adjustments for improved functionality.

  **Think Beyond Flat Surfaces:** Think beyond flat surfaces. Explore ways to create curves, angles, and 3D structures using cardboard.

  **Consider Aesthetics:** While the primary focus is on functionality, discuss the aesthetics of the final product. Consider color, patterns, and visual appeal.

  **Reuse and Recycle:** Remember the sustainability aspect of cardboard. Use recycled cardboard and consider the environmental impact of their creations.
  
  **Collaborate and Share Ideas:** Foster a collaborative environment where everyone can share ideas, seek feedback, and learn from one another's experiences. Collaboration often leads to innovative solutions.

  **Document the Process:** Document all design and construction processes. This can include photos, sketches, and written reflections. Documenting the journey enhances the learning experience.
  
  **Celebrate Creativity:** Lastly, celebrate creativity and the unique solutions you come up with. Take pride in your creations and share you work with the class.

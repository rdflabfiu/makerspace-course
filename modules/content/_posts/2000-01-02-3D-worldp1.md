title: Getting started with 3D
---


## Introduction
 3D worlds await your touch. Blender, a powerful yet accessible 3D modeling software, empowers you to sculpt, animate, and bring your ideas to life. With intuitive tools and a supportive community, anyone can explore the boundless possibilities of 3D creation. Ready to unleash your inner artist?


## Learning objectives
 In this project, we will learn the basics of a 3D Modeling Program, “Blender”. We will dive into the unlimitedly possible things you can do in a digital playground. 

#### Let’s warm up to this digital environment by asking the following questions:
   - How can I define the environment I’m working with?
   - How will I shape the object as I want?
   - What do I need instead of a pencil to create things I imagine?
   - What makes my object so special or different?

#### These will be our achievements from this tutorial:
   - Getting to know the most popular way for 3D modeling.
   - How to control the 3D coordinate systems.
   - 3D Transformations: Ways to shape and play with our objects.
   - Understand boolean operations: Interactions between objects.




## TUTORIALS

#### The 3D space
   - Start by downloading [Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43K1mgIBvOI).
   
   - Check [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4o3s5t0n9g) about coordinates. In 3D Modeling, we use coordinates to figure out the area we are working with.
   
   - To learn about controlling those coordinates, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6XVDqnZYCY&list=PL3GeP3YLZn5hhfaGRSmRia0OwPPMfJu0V&index=3).
   
#### Transformations
   - To simply transform your objects using coordinates, follow along with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa22WtLufDU)
   

#### Boolean operations (CSG)
   - You’ll need to know about modifiers to work with more than one object. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNvbz-lz4ho) out and try to give different looks to your creation.
   
## Activities

#### Tip:
 You can warm up with some cubes or cylinders. Try moving them around and remember your boolean activities to shape your object.
#### Idea: 
 Try making a simple gear to get used to the platform.

## Project

 Check out this [10 Block Challenge](https://blenderartists.org/c/contests/10-cubes-challenge-2022/70) where you have to create a project using exactly 10 cubes/prisms. Think about your goal in this project and what makes it special.
